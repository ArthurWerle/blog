AI has become an integral part of my daily workflow, both professionally and personally. Here's how I leverage various AI tools to enhance productivity and learning:

## Professional Toolkit

At work, I rely on ChatGPT and Claude for multiple critical tasks:

- Generating innovative ideas
- Help in architectural decisions
- Explaining complex code
- Optimizing performance
- Refactoring existing code
- Writing test suites for components
- Creating boilerplate and mocks
- Debugging

## Personal Development

Beyond work, AI assists me in continuous learning:

- Deep-diving into study topics
- Exploring and debating ideas
- Getting detailed explanations on diverse subjects
- Satisfying intellectual curiosity

## Specialized AI Tools

I've integrated different AI platforms for specific needs:

- Perplexity for quick news updates and rapid information gathering
- GitHub Copilot for workplace coding assistance
- Ollama + Complete for personal PC autocomplete
- V0 and Bolt for rapid MVP and boilerplate creation

AI isn't just a toolâ€”it's a collaborative partner that amplifies human potential across professional and personal domains. I cannot see a future without AI. Its integration has transformed the way I work, enabling me to tackle complex problems more efficiently and explore new ideas with greater depth. As I continue to learn and grow, I'm excited about what AI can do for me in the years ahead.
